# Live Catalog Repair Evidence — 2026-08-17

The authenticated production admin session successfully created the missing categories **Long Sleeves** (`long-sleeves`) and **Water Bottles** (`water-bottles`). Both categories use the repository-defined descriptions and storefront image paths.

The admin bulk-upload panel accepted a ten-row CSV batch containing the five repository-defined Long Sleeve products and five Water Bottle products. The live response reported **10 added, 0 failed**. Category IDs used were 6 for Long Sleeves and 7 for Water Bottles.

The source definitions came from `artifacts/api-server/add-trendy-products.ts`; uploaded product slugs were:

- `modern-geometric-long-sleeve`
- `vintage-travel-long-sleeve`
- `artistic-floral-long-sleeve`
- `cyberpunk-future-long-sleeve`
- `minimalist-corporate-long-sleeve`
- `eco-friendly-bamboo-water-bottle`
- `pro-fitness-tracker-bottle`
- `adventure-series-flask`
- `galaxy-space-water-bottle`
- `minimalist-name-bottle`

The storefront image fallback remains active for missing/broken asset URLs, so these records should remain renderable even where historical asset paths are unavailable.
